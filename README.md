# Browser based RSA public/private key message sharing

Because sharing a password should never happen in plain-text.

Imagine Bob is in France and Paul is in the USA. Normally you'd have to go through a tedious load of tools to securely share a password. You definitely don't want to send it via skype, Email or any other text-message. Are you going to call? Maybe for a password that is called: "AGdfds$%$%sdfdfs$$gsddf___gffgfg323"? There is a better way...

# Issues

Happy to have them. If it is something encryption related, please let me know as well. I am no crypto-expert, I just use the algorithms. If there is a specific concern about the usage, I am also happy to remove the repository or put a CLEAR warning out.
